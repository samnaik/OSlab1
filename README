Hello World!

Authors: Sameer Naik, Vani Gupta

This is a project based on peer-to-peer networks as part of the first Lab assignment in Operating Systems 677.

The aim of the project is to build on the Angry Birds game. The pigs in the game can now co-ordinate among themselves in a P2P network and try to avoid an incoming bird attack. A primary pig calculates the trajectory of the bird and co-ordinates this information to the other pigs using a hop-by-hop message transmission. A direct bird attack or falling pillars can cause the pigs to be hurt. Number of pigs is configurable.
